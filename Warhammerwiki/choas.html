            <h2>The Disciples of Tzeentch lurk in the shadows, manipulating the strands of fate to serve their whim. They are bringers of madness and pandemonium, and when they rise up in force, their foes are soon overcome by their masterful ploys and storms of blazing spellcraft.

They triumph over their enemies through arcane firestorms, cunning and sheer unpredictability and their labyrinthine machinations have brought misery and ruin to thousands over the centuries. Tzeentch is known as the Architect of Fate. A mad god of hope and change, he delights in catching mortals in webs of his impossibly convoluted plots, twisting their ideals and ambitions until they serve his ends.

            <h2>The Maggotkin of Nurgle are entropy and sickness given form. Charged by their disgusting deity with spreading disease across the Mortal Realms, they do not let anything stop them from accomplishing their sacred task, shrugging off the mightiest of blows and most potent of spells with wet, gurgling laughs. It can be difficult, at first, to understand why anyone would willingly turn to the worship of Nurgle. The gifs offered by this foul god take the form of putrid poxes and bloating blights, and he is empowered through the despair of those wracked by sickness and despair.

            <h2>the Hedonites of Slaanesh come to bring ecstatic carnage to the realms. Though they may appear graceful, even urbane, such is a sinister mirage - for the Hedonites are monstrously cruel, and their wars are waged as much to spread suffering as to achieve any strategic goal. The Hedonites are the favoured servants and sycophants of the Dark Prince, connoisseurs of excess and ringmasters to carnivals of sin.

They are the chosen race of the Great Horned Rat, one of the five major Chaos Gods, who sees their ascendancy over all the other mortal races of the realms as the key to its own triumph over the other Ruinous Powers in the Great Game played between them for influence and power.
