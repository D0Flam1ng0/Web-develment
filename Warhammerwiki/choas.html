              <h2>when the Dark Gods set aside their ancient hatreds and take a pause from the Great Game. On these rare occasions, they unleash the full might of their daemonic hordes upon reality. The ground twists and the skies burn before the advance of the Legion of Chaos Ascendant, a force of utter desolation united under the eightfold mark of ruin. This daemonic legion is anchored to the material realms by the combined will of the Ruinous Powers and in battle, they call upon infinite reinforcements from the Realm of Chaos. An endless number of hosts form this Legion, each aligned to one of the four Ruinous Powers.
                The main units are a combonation of all the other choas gods and

            <h2>The Disciples of Tzeentch lurk in the shadows, manipulating the strands of fate to serve their whim. They are bringers of madness and pandemonium, and when they rise up in force, their foes are soon overcome by their masterful ploys and storms of blazing spellcraft. They are schemers, warlords and revolutionaries, who in their quest for power, have become both the puppets and puppeteers of fate. They triumph over their enemies through arcane firestorms, cunning and sheer unpredictability and their labyrinthine machinations have brought misery and ruin to thousands over the centuries. Tzeentch is known as the Architect of Fate. A mad god of hope and change, he delights in catching mortals in webs of his impossibly convoluted plots, twisting their ideals and ambitions until they serve his ends.</h2>

            <h2>The Blades of Khorne revel in the carnage of the battlefield. The devoted warriors of the most bloodthirsty of the Chaos Gods, they plunge headlong into the most savage and hate-fuelled fighting imaginable, earning their lord's wrathful favour with each skull they claim. The Ruinous Power known as Khorne is the god of rage and bloodshed, the manifestation of mankind's most hateful emotions</h2>

            <h2>The Maggotkin of Nurgle are entropy and sickness given form. Charged by their disgusting deity with spreading disease across the Mortal Realms, they do not let anything stop them from accomplishing their sacred task, shrugging off the mightiest of blows and most potent of spells with wet, gurgling laughs. It can be difficult, at first, to understand why anyone would willingly turn to the worship of Nurgle. The gifs offered by this foul god take the form of putrid poxes and bloating blights, and he is empowered through the despair of those wracked by sickness and despair.</h2>

            <h2>the Hedonites of Slaanesh come to bring ecstatic carnage to the realms. Though they may appear graceful, even urbane, such is a sinister mirage - for the Hedonites are monstrously cruel, and their wars are waged as much to spread suffering as to achieve any strategic goal. The Hedonites are the favoured servants and sycophants of the Dark Prince, connoisseurs of excess and ringmasters to carnivals of sin.</h2>

            <h2>The Skaven, also called the "Skaventide" and the "ratmen," are true creatures of Chaos, a teeming species of mutant, humanoid rats with a megalomaniacal desire to rule over all creation. They are anarchic, conniving creatures, self-serving back-stabbers who proliferate in the dark corners of the Mortal Realms and beyond. They are the chosen race of the Great Horned Rat, one of the five major Chaos Gods, who sees their ascendancy over all the other mortal races of the realms as the key to its own triumph over the other Ruinous Powers in the Great Game played between them for influence and power.</h2>
